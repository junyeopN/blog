# 1. Low Level Data Oriented Programming
## 1-1. Struct Data Size
* **aligns to the size of the biggest element - defining small members next to each other saves padding**
* ex1)

```C
// 24 Byte - alignment: 8byte(=max(4, 8, 2))
struct A {
    int x; // 4 byte, padded to 8 byte 
    double z; // 8 byte
    short int y; // 2 byte, padded to 8 byte
}

```

* ex2)

```C
// 16 Byte
struct B {
    double z; // 8 byte
    int x; // 4 byte, aligned with y
    short int y; // 2 byte, aligned with x
}
```

# 1-2. Data-driven "OR" Structure - Index over address, Encoding Approach
Modern C and other languages have enum types that help save optional data members when they are not needed.

* For example, say there is a Person struct as below:

```Cpp
/// 24 byte for all 100% of people, even though only 20% of people are adults and have driver's licence.
/// If there is 1024 people, 24 Byte * 1024 = 24KB
struct Person {
    int id
    int age
    Country country

    const Country { Korea, Japan }

    // optional data - only adults have it, which is 20% of the whole population
    DriversLicense license;

    struct DriversLicense {
        int year_acquired
        int month_acquired
        int day_acquired
    };
}
```

* Based on our "observation of Data" that "only 20% of the population is adult" and "There are only two nationality to the whole population: Korean and Japanese", **we can plan optimization for the Person Struct - dividing the Person into Adult and Non-adult will result in significant memory save.**
* to do this, we can **encode people into four different enum categories, saving data when the person belongs to a category that doesn't have driver's license.**
```Cpp
// Data observation 1: There are only two nationalities: Korean and Japanese
// Data observation 2: Only 20% of the whole population have Driver's License
// Data observation 3: driver's license only have members of same size - no danger for overpadding for alignment.
struct Person {
    Tag tag
    Common common

    const Tag = enum {
        KoreanWithDriversLicense, // 25 byte
        KoreanWithoutDriversLicense, // 13 byte
        JapaneseWithDriversLicense, // 25 byte
        JapaneseWithoutDriversLicense // 13 byte
    }

    const Common = struct {
        int id
        int age
        usize_t extra_index
    }

    const DriversLicense = struct {
        int year_acquired
        int month_acquired
        int day_acquired
    }
}

// When 1024 people,
// population size: 13 byte * 1024 = 13KB
var population: MultiArrayList(Person)
// population_with_drivers_license size: 25 byte * 128 = 3.125KB
var population_with_drivers_license: ArrayList(Person.DriversLicense)

// Total Memory: 16.125KB = 33% memory save
```
