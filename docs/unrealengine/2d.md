## Import Character Sprite

- https://axulart.itch.io/small-8-direction-characters
- import the .png file to Content/Character(new directory)
- rename to T_Red to make it easier to work with
- right click png file -> sprite actions -> Extract Sprites
  ![paper2d](../../images/paperzd2.png)

- right click + drag to move viewport -> **the sprites have spaces between them, so we can't use it immediately**

![paperzd3](../../images/paperzd3.png)

- change sprite extract material to grid

![paperzd4](../../images/paperzd4.png)

- We divide evenly. There's 8/12 sprites per col/row, so adjust grid width/height accordingly

![paperzd5](../../images/paperzd5.png)

- Extract, there's 8 directions so create directory for each direction and move all corresponding sprite to the folders

![paperzd6](../../images/paperzd6.png)

- Find the Idle sprite, and right click -> create flipbook(FB_Red_Idle_Down)

![paperzd7](../../images/paperzd7.png)

- Select the two other sprites -> create flipbook(FB_Red_Walk_Down)

![paperzd8](../../images/paperzd8.png)

- Do the same for all directions

![paperzd9](../../images/paperzd9.png)

- Animations are too fast, so we'll adjust frame rate in bulk. Filter to paper flipbook

![paperzd10](../../images/paperzd10.png)

- Select all sprites and bulk edit

![paperzd11](../../images/paperzd11.png)

- Select all in the bulk edit window -> edit fps to 7 -> save all (ctrl+s)

![paperzd12](../../images/paperzd12.png)

- Create new directory Sprites and move all directories inside

![paperzd13](../../images/paperzd13.png)

- Create New Blueprint Class -> PaperZDCharacter

![paperzd14](../../images/paperzd14.png)

- Open Blueprint Editor -> Sprite -> Source Flipbook -> IdleDown

![paperzd15](../../images/paperzd15.png)

- Sprite is too small

![paperzd16](../../images/paperzd16.png)

- Bulk edit all sprites' pixel per unit from 1 -> 0.2

![paperzd17](../../images/paperzd17.png)

- Change sprite rotation X to -90 and capsule component half height to 50

![paperzd19](../../images/paperzd19.png)

- When we drag to character to the level, the character floats

![paperzd20](../../images/paperzd20.png)

- Change sprite z to -49.5 (doing 50 will position sprite below the surface, making it unmovable)

![paperzd21](../../images/paperzd21.png)

- Add Spring Arm and attack a camera to the spring arm

![paperzd22](../../images/paperzd22.png)

- Rotate Camera -90 Yaw, and then up to make top down camera.

![paperzd23](../../images/paperzd23.png)

- Exit Blueprint Editor. Now we can see how it shows on the camera.

![paperzd24](../../images/paperzd24.png)

- right click -> paperzd -> animationsource

![paperzd25](../../images/paperzd25.png)

- add new -> animation sequence -> name idle

![paperzd26](../../images/paperzd26.png)

- Since we have 8 directions, check "multi-directional sequence", N = 8. Set idle direction flipbook for all 8 directions.

![paperzd27](../../images/paperzd27.png)

- Create Walk animation sequence doing the same thing

- Now create PaperZD -> PaperZD AnimBP using our AS

![paperzd28](../../images/paperzd28.png)

- In the AnimBP Blueprint Editor, open AnimGraph and add Play Walk Node.

![paperzd29](../../images/paperzd29.png)

- Open TopDownCharacter BP, click Animation Component -> set Anim Instance Class to ABP_TopDownChar

![paperzd30](../../images/paperzd30.png)

- Go back to ABP_TopDownChar and set directionality

![paperzd31](../../images/paperzd31.png)

- Create an Input folder, go in and create Input Action

![paperzd32](../../images/paperzd32.png)

- Open the IA, Set Value Type Axis2D

![paperzd33](../../images/paperzd33.png)

- Now creater Input Mapping Component

![paperzd34](../../images/paperzd34.png)

- Add Input Action to mapping

![paperzd35](../../images/paperzd35.png)

- Add "Swizzle Input Axis Values" to modifier to change w's axis to Y for W and S, and "Negate" Modifier for A and D

![paperzd36](../../images/paperzd36.png)

- Add the controller and map the IA_move to world axis in Character Blueprint

![paperzd37](../../images/paperzd37.png)

- Now to map events. go to ABP_TopDownchar and save BP_TopDownChar as variable

![paperzd38](../../images/paperzd38.png)

- Set Animation Blueprint to run when pressing button + depending on direction

![paperzd39](../../images/paperzd39.png)
