# Welcome To My Blog

## 1. Working Career

I'm in my 5th year working as a Data Scientist, and also have experience in Backend Engineering. I team that services Map application. I specialize in:

1. Rust/C++ backend engineering
   - As a junior I was in charge of the backend server that calculated the Walkpath.
   - Was in charge of route searching part of our Map Server(1 year), improving subway route search time by 200%,
   - Refactored the whole Maps Rust Backend Server which was using libraries that were deprecated 3 years ago, improving 99% latency by 10%(3000ms -> 2700ms) and Max latency by 85%(9600ms -> 5200ms)
   - Tryed hard to improve our team's working culture:
     1. I was the first to add Team Coding Convention for the backend engine
     2. I doubled our backend server's number of tests
     3. Provided documentation for the backend server's hard-to-understand legacy parts as I refactored it.
2. Machine learning / Deep Learning(Spark, Pandas, Polars, Tensorflow)

   - In charge of building the first AI model for predicting the arrival time of a given car route.
   - The data pipeline was built using spark, and the model was made in pandas/tensorflow.
   - Improved duration estimation by 3%p (14%p -> 11%p)
   - After building the model I specialized more in data pipeline, so I'm fluent with data science libraries that are used for data pipelines, such as Spark/Pandas/Polars/Numpy/Airflow.
   - By configuring our team's spark sessions, our team's Spark applications saw 10% speed improvements.

3. Real-time Wifi Positioning System(2023-2024)
   - When trying to implement Public Transportation Navigation service, there was one problem: we can't use GPS to locate users' real-time location in subway stations
   - Used user's WIFI logs and labeled field data to figure out Wifis that belong to each station.
   - DBSCAN to filter out train's highly mobile Wifi, then use RSSI/GPS related features to
   - For 4000 labeled Wifi Station data on all Korean Subway, acheived accuracy and precision above 95% - signed off and made Naver's Navigation Service Possible
   - In 2024,

## 2. Side Projects
